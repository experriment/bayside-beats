Bayside Beats is based on the Adobe Dreamweaver online tutorial. The main difference is that this is all coded by hand in a text editor and does not use Adobe programs like Dreamweaver.

All images and content belong to Adobe however the construction may differ from what they produced, as we are teaching the student how to deliver a product (website) without using Adobe products.
